Big thank you to the following resources:

## Remote repositories

List and add remotes

```shell
git remote -v
git remote add upstream <upstream repo>
```

## Git Diff

List filenames different between branches
```shell
git diff upstream/master origin/master --name-only
```

Generate a patch

```shell
git diff > my.patch

git diff upstream/master origin/master > my.patch
git apply my.patch
```

## Save yourself

Reflog: `git reflog` will show the previous states of your repository. You can reset or checkout to a specific reflog commit or a certain amount of repo actions back. (e.g. `git reset HEAD@{3}` will reset your local git state to whatever was 3 git actions ago)

Reset local branch to some other branch (like upstream)
```shell
git reset --hard upstream/<branch name>
```
## Better Rebasing

Quick Squash of last 3 commits
```shell
git reset --soft HEAD~3 && git commit --edit -m'blah'
```
