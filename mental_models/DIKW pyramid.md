## TLDR

Deep understanding of the subject emerges by passing through four qualitative stages: _D_ – data, _I_ – information, _K_ – knowledge and _W_ – wisdom

**Data**: raw, unprocessed facts and figures (and anecdotes) without context. Holds limited value in isolation.

**Information**: Organized and contextualized data. Can answer "who," "what," "where," and "when."

**Knowledge** Uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships. "how" and "why" certain phenomena occur.

**Wisdom** Ability for *well-informed* decisions and *effective* action based on underlying knowledge.

## Learnings
- [[wsmisms]]: On consensus building (e.g. design decisions)
	- Progress up pyramid from objective **D**ata  **TO** insightful **W**isdom
	- Build consensus at each step 
		- Show your work
		- Don't skip to spouting wisdom while knowing nothing (Like some non-technical folk)
		- Don't linger at data collection for too long (Get to the point)
			- [[Bezos]]: "You should make great decisions with 70% of the data you want to have"
				- Even less if it's a 2-way door
- Great [[Dashboards]] should automate D & I and help with K
	- But in observable way where you can validate D
